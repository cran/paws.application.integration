\title{Provides information about a state machine's definition, its IAM role
Amazon Resource Name (ARN), and configuration}
\usage{
sfn_describe_state_machine(stateMachineArn, includedData = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{stateMachineArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine for which you want
the information.

If you specify a state machine version ARN, this API returns details
about that version. The version ARN is a combination of state machine
ARN and the version number separated by a colon (:). For example,
\code{stateMachineARN:1}.}

\item{includedData}{If your state machine definition is encrypted with a KMS key, callers
must have \code{kms:Decrypt} permission to decrypt the definition.
Alternatively, you can call the API with \code{includedData = METADATA_ONLY}
to get a successful response without the encrypted definition.

When calling a labelled ARN for an encrypted state machine, the
\code{includedData = METADATA_ONLY} parameter will not apply because Step
Functions needs to decrypt the entire state machine definition to get
the Distributed Map stateâ€™s definition. In this case, the API caller
needs to have \code{kms:Decrypt} permission.}
